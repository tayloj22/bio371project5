Our mouse Codon Usage Table example:
Mus musculus [gbrod]: 53036 CDS's (24533776 codons)

Please note that if any spaces occur between the frequency and count within the codon usage table, our program will treat them as separate tokens and misfile information.  This may occur if the count is smaller than the rest, and must be fixed before our program can properly parse it.
